                <p class="introtext">As the world becomes increasingly automated, it is forcing underwriters to adapt and
                     navigate a new risk environment. Meanwhile insurers are leveraging the potential 
                    of AI themselves to remain competitive, improve processes
                     and increase efficiency. Lloyd’s have commissioned two reports in collaboration with the
                     University of Surrey that explore these trends in more detail.<br>
                     <br>
                        “Taking control: artificial intelligence and insurance” analyses the associated 
                        risks of AI implementation
                         as well as the potential for AI to help insurers improve 
                        their operations and develop new products. Building on this, 
                        “Taking control: robots and risk” investigates the impact “collaborative robots” 
                        (or cobots) on the economy, 
                        and the subsequent risks implications for the insurance industry.</p>

                <p class="paragraphone">This report identifies four risks areas for AI: trust and transparency, ethics, 
                    security and safety. It highlights
                     that as artificial intelligence systems become more complex, cyber breaches are 
                     likely to have an 
                     even greater impact. The report also explores new business opportunities for insurers 
                    from developing new products for 
                    companies using the AI to applying the technology to 
                    improve insurance processes and deliver better value.</p>

                <p class="paragraphthree">In the future millions of jobs could be taken over by increasingly sophisticated robots or 
                    cobots (“collaborative robots”), according to various predictions. 
                    This report explores robotics potential to significantly change the risk landscape in many 
                    parts of the economy, including: manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare and retail. It also
                    explores the opportunity for insurers to collaborate with clients as data from cobots will 
                    provide a much greater understanding of risk and offer 
                    opportunities for improved risks and pricing models.</p>
